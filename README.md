# :relieved: 2048
This is a simple 2048 program game that I made while following a guide at 3am on YouTube because I was bored and wanted an offline game that was accessible for me. Ultimately, it's nothing unique or impressive but it's easy to follow, recreate and use in the grand scheme of things.

### Warnings:
- Since content size is relative to one another, adjusting window size would become problematic since its movement speed (delta) and tile size are independent.
- Spamming direction keys would result in a big delay in input reading.
